What are the differences between a static visualization and a shiny app and when are each of these most appropriate?\nStatic Visualization * Definition: A static visualization is a fixed image or chart that does not change or respond to user interaction. It is created and rendered once, and displays the same information each time it is viewed.\n\nCreation Tools: Static visualizations can be created using a variety of tools and libraries, such as Matplotlib, ggplot, and others.\nInteractivity: Static visualizations do not have interactivity. Users cannot interact with the visualization to change what is displayed or to explore the data further.\nUse Cases:\n\nWhen you need to communicate a specific, predetermined message or finding.\nIn reports, publications, or presentations where the data and the message are fixed.\nWhen the audience does not need to interact with the data to understand the message.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nSimpler to create and embed in documents.\nNo need for a live server or internet connection to view.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nLimited engagement and exploration for the audience.\nCannot adapt to different user needs or questions.\n\n\nShiny App\n\nDefinition: A Shiny app is a web application that provides interactive visualizations and interfaces, allowing users to manipulate inputs and see the changes in the outputs in real-time.\nCreation Tools: Shiny apps are primarily created using the Shiny package in R.\nInteractivity: Shiny apps are highly interactive. Users can input data, adjust parameters, and interact with the visualizations directly.\nUse Cases:\n\nWhen you want to create an interactive tool for data analysis or visualization.\nFor exploratory data analysis, where users might have different questions and need to interact with the data to find answers.\nWhen you want to create a dashboard or application for monitoring or reporting, with real-time or reactive updates.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nHighly engaging and adaptable to user needs.\nFacilitates exploration and discovery in the data.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nRequires a live server or internet connection to view.\nCan be more complex and time-consuming to create.\nMight require additional resources for hosting and maintenance.\n\n\nWhen to Use Each:\n\nUse a Static Visualization When:\n\nThe message or insight you want to convey is fixed and does not require user interaction.\nYou need to embed the visualization in a document, report, or presentation.\nYour audience is not expected to engage deeply with the data.\n\nUse a Shiny App When:\n\nYou want to provide a dynamic, interactive tool for data analysis or exploration.\nYour audience has varying questions and needs that require interacting with the data.\nYou want to create a real-time dashboard or reporting tool.\n\n\nIn summary, if the goal is to communicate a specific insight or message in a straightforward manner, a static visualization might be more appropriate. If the goal is to provide a tool for data exploration, analysis, or real-time monitoring, a Shiny app might be a better fit.\n\n\n2. What are types of communication and give examples for each of them?\n\nIntrapersonal - communicating with one-self\n\nThinking: Engaging in internal dialogue to solve a problem or make a decision.\nJournaling: Writing down one’s thoughts and feelings in a personal diary.\nMeditating: Practicing mindfulness or meditation to clear one’s mind and focus inward.\n\nDyadic/interpersonal - two people interacting\n\nOne-on-One Conversation: Engaging in a conversation with a friend, family member, or colleague.\nJob Interview: The interaction between a job applicant and an interviewer.\nTherapy Session: A private session between a therapist and a client.\n\nSmall group - two or more people interacting with group membership\n\nTeam Meeting: A meeting involving a small group of colleagues working together on a project.\nStudy Group: A group of students gathering to study or work on assignments together.\nBook Club: A small group of people meeting regularly to discuss a book they have read.\n\nPublic - a group too large for all to contribute\n\nPublic Speaking: Delivering a speech or presentation to an audience.\nLectures: A professor giving a lecture to a class of students.\nTown Hall Meeting: A public meeting where officials address the community and take a limited number of questions from attendees.\n\nMass - messages transmitted to large, wide-spread audiences via media\n\nTelevision Broadcasting: News, shows, or movies broadcasted to a wide audience.\nNewspaper Articles: Written articles made available to the public through newspapers.\nSocial Media Posts: Content created by organizations or influencers intended to reach a large number of followers.\n\n\n\n\n3. What makes a presentation effective in your opinion?\nFollow the hourglass structure: * Focus more on the hook and preview * Less focus on methods, data, and details * Focus more conclusions and takeaways\n\n\n4. Explain how the input and output objects work together in Shiny application?\n\nIn a Shiny application, the input and output objects play central roles, facilitating the reactive programming model that allows for real-time user interaction and dynamic data updates. Here’s an explanation of how they work together:\nInput Object:\n\nThe input object in Shiny is a list-like object that stores the values of user inputs.\nIt includes values from sliders, text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and other input widgets.\nWhen a user interacts with an input widget, the corresponding value in the input object is updated. The input values can be accessed using the $ operator, like input$inputId.\n\nOutput Object:\n\nThe output object is used to store the UI elements that need to be rendered or updated based on the user input or other reactive expressions.\nOutput elements can include tables, plots, text, and more.\nYou define output elements in the server function of your Shiny app and assign them a unique output ID.\nYou use corresponding Shiny functions like renderPlot, renderTable, etc., to define how the output should be calculated and rendered.\n\nHow They Work Together:\n\nReactivity: When the value of an input changes, any reactive expressions (including outputs) that depend on that input are automatically re-evaluated and updated.\nServer-Client Communication: Shiny apps operate in a client-server model. The user interface (client) sends input changes to the server, which processes the inputs, updates any reactive expressions, and sends the updated output back to the client to be rendered.\nExample: Imagine a Shiny app with a slider (for input) and a plot (for output). The user moves the slider, updating an input value. Any reactive expressions or outputs that depend on that slider value are then automatically re-evaluated. If the plot output depends on the slider input, the plot is re-rendered to reflect the new input value.\n\n\n\n\n5. What are the methods of hosting the outputs of a quarto document?\n\nQuarto Pub\nGitHub Pages\nNetlify"

These generally should convey:\n\nvariables in the data,\nthe number of observations for each variable,\nmissing values (if any),\nthe distribution, e.g. in the form of five number of summaries or counts/percentages for categorical variables.\n\n\n\n\nFor numerical variables, you may have a correlation table which displays the correlation coefficients of every pair of variables. Because it is symmetrical, you can omit out the upper triangle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nMean\nSD\n1.\n2.\n\n\n\n\n1. Miles per gallon\n20.09\n6.03\n\n\n\n\n2. Weight\n3.22\n0.98\n-0.87\n\n\n\n3.
