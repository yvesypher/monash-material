## Practice Set 1

## 1. Explain the Quarto workflow for creating a HTML report. What do you write, and how is it transformed? What are some of the output formats you can specify?

-   Quarto is written in a (modified) form of Markdown

-   This is converted to markdown

-   Computation is handled using knitr or a language-specific equivalent pandoc converts this to the desired output format

-   Some of the output formats include: docx, pptx, html and pdf.

## 2. Describe the purpose of a vignette, including ewhat type of information goes into one, and the technical details of how one is written. Give an example of the code used to create a vignette.

-   Long-form documentation
-   Include full examples of how to use a package
-   Written in RMarkdown
-   Included as part of a package installation
-   Provide a practical guide to a package, similar to a blog post or interactive tutorial
-   Easiest way to create is usethis::use_vignette()

## 3. Explain the difference between the linear and transactional communication model.

-   Linear communication model:
    -   has sender and receiver in a line
    -   Sender transmits a signal, it is affected by noise, then decoded by the receiver
    -   It is a one-way communication system
-   Transactional communicaiton model:
    -   2 way communication system
    -   It implies communication is continuous, ongoing process
    -   There is more noise in this model (due to more communication).
-   There is no ideal way to communicate but the preferred model is transactional, as it reflects the back and forth between sender and recevier.

## 1. What are some examples of information you might want to extract from a fitted linear model? What would be a good way to communicate these items?

-   Examples of information you might want to extract from a fitted linear model:
    -   Model paramter estimates
    -   Model-related summary statistics ($R^2$, AIC, BIC)
    -   Residuals
    -   Fitted values
    -   Predictions
-   First two are good to present in a table, the last three are often best presented as visuals

## 2. What is the ideal structure for a report or article? How does this differ to the structure for presentations?

-   Reports and articles have:

    -   Introduction
    -   Literature
    -   Data
    -   Methods
    -   Results
    -   Conclusion

-   The structure is generally the shape of a pyramid, with most time spent on methods, results and conclusions.

-   This differs from presentations that use the hourglass structure, with little information on methods and most time spent on the 'hook' and the conclusion. Presentations tend to not have a literature section and do not contain as much detail as the report.

### 3. Describe the checklist for asking a good question.

-   Is the problem clearly and succintly described?

-   Is the expected solution or behaviour outlined?

-   Are you asking the right people at the right place?

-   Can people who can answer find your question?

-   Can the problem be easily reproduced on other people's system?

-   Is the minimum reproducible code or steps supplied?

-   Is the data supplied?

-   If the data is big, could you cull your data to communicate or reproduce your problem?

## Practice set 3

### 1. Describe 4 of the different R Shiny inputs, and describe how changing these values can affect the app.

-   R Shiny inputs:

-   `actionButton`, `actionLink`: Have no outputs,

-   `checkboxInput`, `checkboxGroupInput`: Checkboxes with some choices

-   `fileInput`: Allows user to upload a file into the app

-   `numericInput`: User enters a number

-   `radioButttons`: Button that allows user to select one input

-   `passwordInput`: Like textInput but hides output from the user

-   `textInput`: User enters a string

-   `dateInput`, `dateRangeInput`: User picks dates, has a nice calendar selector

-   `selectInput`: User picks from a dropdown

-   `sliderInput`: User picks from a slider

-   `selectizeInput`: User adds from a dropdown to a list of options

-   All of these inputs trigger reactive events, based on whether or not the corresponding input is present in the server section of the shiny app.

-   The relevant function will automatically be evaluated if any of it's inputs inside change.

## 2. Name four of the naming cases conventions and describe them

-   `camelCase`: Capitalise all words after the first. Common in Shiny and JavaScript

-   `PascalCase`: Capitalise all words. Used often in C.

-   `snake_case`: All words lower case, separated by underscore. Convention in R

-   `kebab-case`: All words lower case, separate by dash. Common in HTML and CSS property names.

## 3. Describe the difference between a website and a webpage. Tell me how HTML and CSS work together to create a page.

-   A webpage is a single page, usually written in HTML, that displays content in a webbrowser
-   A website is a collection of webpages
-   HTML provides the structure of the webpage, telling the browser where everything goes
-   CSS controls the look and feel (or style) of the webpage.
-   CSS is optional, HTML is required.
-   CSS changes elements of HTML, identified by IDs, classes, or elements

## Practice set 4

## 1. What are the differences between a static visualization and a shiny app and when are each of these most appropriate?

**Static Visualization** \* Definition: A static visualization is a fixed image or chart that does not change or respond to user interaction. It is created and rendered once, and displays the same information each time it is viewed.

-   Creation Tools: Static visualizations can be created using a variety of tools and libraries, such as Matplotlib, ggplot, and others.

-   Interactivity: Static visualizations do not have interactivity. Users cannot interact with the visualization to change what is displayed or to explore the data further.

-   Use Cases:

    -   When you need to communicate a specific, predetermined message or finding.
    -   In reports, publications, or presentations where the data and the message are fixed.
    -   When the audience does not need to interact with the data to understand the message.

-   Advantages:

    -   Simpler to create and embed in documents.
    -   No need for a live server or internet connection to view.

-   Disadvantages:

    -   Limited engagement and exploration for the audience.
    -   Cannot adapt to different user needs or questions.

**Shiny App**

-   Definition: A Shiny app is a web application that provides interactive visualizations and interfaces, allowing users to manipulate inputs and see the changes in the outputs in real-time.

-   Creation Tools: Shiny apps are primarily created using the Shiny package in R.

-   Interactivity: Shiny apps are highly interactive. Users can input data, adjust parameters, and interact with the visualizations directly.

-   Use Cases:

    -   When you want to create an interactive tool for data analysis or visualization.
    -   For exploratory data analysis, where users might have different questions and need to interact with the data to find answers.
    -   When you want to create a dashboard or application for monitoring or reporting, with real-time or reactive updates.

-   Advantages:

    -   Highly engaging and adaptable to user needs.
    -   Facilitates exploration and discovery in the data.

-   Disadvantages:

    -   Requires a live server or internet connection to view.
    -   Can be more complex and time-consuming to create.
    -   Might require additional resources for hosting and maintenance.

**When to Use Each:**

-   Use a Static Visualization When:

    -   The message or insight you want to convey is fixed and does not require user interaction.
    -   You need to embed the visualization in a document, report, or presentation.
    -   Your audience is not expected to engage deeply with the data.

-   Use a Shiny App When:

    -   You want to provide a dynamic, interactive tool for data analysis or exploration.
    -   Your audience has varying questions and needs that require interacting with the data.
    -   You want to create a real-time dashboard or reporting tool.

In summary, if the goal is to communicate a specific insight or message in a straightforward manner, a static visualization might be more appropriate. If the goal is to provide a tool for data exploration, analysis, or real-time monitoring, a Shiny app might be a better fit.

## 2. What are types of communication and give examples for each of them?

-   Intrapersonal - communicating with one-self

    -   Thinking: Engaging in internal dialogue to solve a problem or make a decision.

    -   Journaling: Writing down one's thoughts and feelings in a personal diary.

    -   Meditating: Practicing mindfulness or meditation to clear one's mind and focus inward.

-   Dyadic/interpersonal - two people interacting

    -   One-on-One Conversation: Engaging in a conversation with a friend, family member, or colleague.

    -   Job Interview: The interaction between a job applicant and an interviewer.

    -   Therapy Session: A private session between a therapist and a client.

-   Small group - two or more people interacting with group membership

    -   Team Meeting: A meeting involving a small group of colleagues working together on a project.

    -   Study Group: A group of students gathering to study or work on assignments together.

    -   Book Club: A small group of people meeting regularly to discuss a book they have read.

-   Public - a group too large for all to contribute

    -   Public Speaking: Delivering a speech or presentation to an audience.

    -   Lectures: A professor giving a lecture to a class of students.

    -   Town Hall Meeting: A public meeting where officials address the community and take a limited number of questions from attendees.

-   Mass - messages transmitted to large, wide-spread audiences via media

    -   **Television Broadcasting**: News, shows, or movies broadcasted to a wide audience.

    -   **Newspaper Articles**: Written articles made available to the public through newspapers.

    -   **Social Media Posts**: Content created by organizations or influencers intended to reach a large number of followers.

## 3. What makes a presentation effective in your opinion?

Follow the hourglass structure:
* Focus more on the hook and preview
* Less focus on methods, data, and details
* Focus more conclusions and takeaways

## 4. Explain how the input and output objects work together in Shiny application?

-   In a Shiny application, the input and output objects play central roles, facilitating the reactive programming model that allows for real-time user interaction and dynamic data updates. Here's an explanation of how they work together:

-   Input Object:

    -   The input object in Shiny is a list-like object that stores the values of user inputs.

    -   It includes values from sliders, text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and other input widgets.

    -   When a user interacts with an input widget, the corresponding value in the input object is updated. The input values can be accessed using the `$` operator, like `input$inputId`.

-   Output Object:

    -   The output object is used to store the UI elements that need to be rendered or updated based on the user input or other reactive expressions.

    -   Output elements can include tables, plots, text, and more.

    -   You define output elements in the server function of your Shiny app and assign them a unique output ID.

    -   You use corresponding Shiny functions like renderPlot, renderTable, etc., to define how the output should be calculated and rendered.

-   How They Work Together:

    -   Reactivity: When the value of an input changes, any reactive expressions (including outputs) that depend on that input are automatically re-evaluated and updated.

    -   Server-Client Communication: Shiny apps operate in a client-server model. The user interface (client) sends input changes to the server, which processes the inputs, updates any reactive expressions, and sends the updated output back to the client to be rendered.

    -   Example: Imagine a Shiny app with a slider (for input) and a plot (for output). The user moves the slider, updating an input value. Any reactive expressions or outputs that depend on that slider value are then automatically re-evaluated. If the plot output depends on the slider input, the plot is re-rendered to reflect the new input value.

## 5. What are the methods of hosting the outputs of a quarto document?

-   Quarto Pub
-   GitHub Pages
-   Netlify
