## Aim

-   Basic communication theory and its relevancy with communicating with data
-   Demonstrate communication competency by selecting appropriate behaviour based on audience and self monitoring
-   Identify and apply rhetorical elements to improve data storytelling
-   Clearly articulate and express technical problems for others to help you
:::

::: callout-tip
## Why

-   Effective communication with data is a blend of hard and soft skills
-   You need the hard skills to process and understand the data
-   But you also need the soft skills to get the message across to others
:::

## Communicating

::: blockquote
To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.

[-- Anthony Robbins]{.fr}
:::

## Communicating [with data]{.monash-blue}

::: blockquote
The two words 'information' and 'communication' are often used interchangeably, but they signify quite different things. Information is giving out; **communication is getting through**.

[-- Sydney J. Harris]{.fr}
:::

## The Basics of [Communication Theory]{.monash-blue}

::: callout-warning
### Communication here refers to human communication

In this section, communication refers to ***human*** communication.
:::

### Communication is [symbolic]{.monash-blue}

::: incremental
-   Arbitrary nature of symbols is overcome with linguistic rules
-   Agreement among people about these rules is required to effectively communicate
-   Meanings rest in people, not words
:::

### Communication is a [process]{.monash-blue}

Communication is often thought of as discrete, independent acts but in fact it is a continuous, ongoing process.

**Transactional communication model**

:::

### Communication [competence]{.monash-blue}

::: incremental
-   **There is no single, ideal way to communicate**
-   Competence is situational and relational (where, what and who)
-   Ability to **select the most appropriate behaviour** in a particular situation
-   Skill to **perform behaviour** not just knowing them
-   **Empathy** or perspective taking
-   **Cognitive complexity** -- ability to construct a variety of framework for viewing an issue
-   **Self-monitoring** -- paying close to your own behaviour and use this to shape your behaviour
:::

### [Types]{.monash-blue} of communication

-   **Intrapersonal** [-- communicating with one-self]{.fragment}
-   **Dyadic/interpersonal** [-- two people interacting]{.fragment}
-   **Small group** [-- two or more people interacting with group membership]{.fragment}
-   **Public** [-- a group too large for all to contribute]{.fragment}
-   **Mass** [-- messages transmitted to large, wide-spread audiences via media]{.fragment}

### [Effective]{.monash-blue} communication

::: incremental
-   Communication doesn't always require complete understanding

-   We notice some messages more and ignore others, e.g. we tend to notice messages that are:

    -   **intense**,
    -   **repetitious**
    -   **constrastive**.

-   **Motives** also determine what information we select from environment
:::

::: notes
-   We are influenced by what is most obvious
:::

## Rhetorics - The art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing

### Rhetorical Triangle

<center><img src="images/drawn/rhetorical-triangle.png"/></center>

-   Ethos - Writer. Make it clear why people listen to you

-   Pathos - Audience. Appeal/Convince to the audience to listen to you. Engage them.

-   Logos - Context. Audience will put things in context for them. Make sure it will make sense.

### Rhetorical Situation

-   Writer or Speaker -> Who's the writer/speaker?
-   Purpose -> Why am I telling this?
-   Message -> What do they need to know?
-   Audience -> Who's ur audience?
-   Context -> What's context u put the work in so that audience listen to ur message?

::: blockquote
No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story.

[-- Daniel Kahneman]{.fr}
:::

::: blockquote
Maybe stories are just data with a soul.

[-- Brene Brown]{.fr}

## Communicating *your problem*

-   Asking for help, requires you to communicate what your problem is to another party.

-   How you communicate your problem, can assist you greatly in getting the answer to your problem.

### 🆘 Asking for help

#### Example 1:

<center><img src="images/stackoverflow-1.png" class="border-box" width="900px" style="padding:0px"/></center>

#### Example 2:

::: {.ba .pa3}
I am looking to adjust the size of two separate ggplots within the same R chunk in Rmarkdown. These plots must be different when outputted as a pdf, so defining the dimensions at the beginning of the chunk doesn't work. Does anyone have any ideas? My code is below.

```` md
`r ''````{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 3}
ggplot(df, aes(weight, height)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(df, aes(height, volume)) +
  geom_point()
```
````
:::

::: notes
-   could not find function "ggplot"
-   the package needs to be loaded
:::

#### Example 3:

::: {.ba .pa3}
I am looking to adjust the size of two separate ggplots within the same R chunk in Rmarkdown. These plots must be different when outputted as a pdf, so defining the dimensions at the beginning of the chunk doesn't work. Does anyone have any ideas? My code is below.

#### Example 4:

::: {.ba .pa3}
I am looking to adjust the size of two separate ggplots within the same R chunk in Rmarkdown. These plots must be different when outputted as a pdf, so defining the dimensions at the beginning of the chunk doesn't work. Does anyone have any ideas? My code is below.

::: notes
-   Is the data used in this question necessarily for the question?
-   Do we even have a copy of `mydata.csv`??

### ❓ How to ask questions?

#### Checklist [(note: not an exhaustive checklist)]{.f4}

<label class="checkbox-container">Is the problem clearly and succinctly described? <input type="checkbox"></label>

<label class="checkbox-container">Is the expected solution or behaviour outlined? <input type="checkbox"></label>

<label class="checkbox-container">Are you asking the right people at the right place? <input type="checkbox"> </label>

#### If the question is **asked in an public forum** or similar:

<label class="checkbox-container">Can people who can answer your question find your question? E.g. does the post have appropriate tags or keywords to reach the right experts? <input type="checkbox"> </label>

#### If the **problem is computer system related**...

<label class="checkbox-container">Can the problem be easily reproduced on other people's system? <input type="checkbox"> </label> <label class="checkbox-container">Is the minimum reproducible code or steps supplied? <input type="checkbox"> </label>

#### If the **problem is based on data** ...

<label class="checkbox-container">Is the data supplied? <input type="checkbox"> </label> <label class="checkbox-container">If the data is big, could you cull your data further to communicate or reproduce the problem? <input type="checkbox"> </label>

### 🆘 Asking for help

#### Example 1:

::: flex
::: w-60
<img src="images/stackoverflow-1.png" class="border-box" width="100%" style="padding:0px"/>
:::

::: {.w-40 .pl3}

#### Example 2:

::: flex
::: w-30
-   How about the question on the right?
-   What makes it *hard* or *easy* for people to answer this question?
:::

::: w-70

:::
:::

::: notes
-   In this example, the author provides the data but it requires work for others to read this data in.
:::

### Session Information

You can easily get the session information in R using `sessioninfo::session_info()`. <br>[Scroll to see the packages used to make these slides.]{.f4}

::: {.overflow-scroll .h-70}
```{r, include = FALSE}
options(width = 80)
```

```{r}
sessioninfo::session_info()
```
:::

### 🎁 Reproducible Example with `reprex`

-   Copy your **minimum reproducible example** then run

```{r, eval = FALSE}
reprex::reprex(session_info = TRUE)
```

-   Once you run the above command, your clipboard contains the formatted code and output for you to paste into places like [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-an-issue), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and forums powered by [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), e.g. [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/).
-   For general code questions, I suggest that you post to the community forums rather than Moodle.

::: callout-important
## Summary

-   Communication is a symbolic, ongoing process that requires ***getting through*** to other parties
-   There is no single ideal way to communicate -- communication competence depends on situation and relations but a competent communicator can select and perform appropriate behaviour based on **seeing other people's perspectives** and **understanding their own behaviour**
-   We discussed about the **elements of rhetorics** and how it relates to telling a compelling data story
-   We looked at the case study with communicating your problem to ask for help
